### Blogs
* `(?i)(512pixels|anxiousmachine|chambersdaily|david-smith|cgpgrey|macsparky|mjtsai|oleb|patricklenz|sixcolors)\.[a-z]{2,3}\/(blog|bradleychamber|links|posts?)` — I already follow these blogs via RSS, so I don't want to see their duplicate Twitter posts.

* `(?i)(betalogue|bitsplitting|brettterpstra|candlerblog|carpeaqua|caseyliss|cormachogan|danfrakes|daringfireball|derflounder\.wordpress|derekseaman|developingperspective|theexecutionersbong\.wordpress|furbo|gedblog|hypertext|inessential|kottke|macdrifter|macmule|neglectedpotential|rantbox|rocketink|rustyshelf|shawnblanc|thesynopsis|yellow-bricks)\.[a-z]{2,3}\/[0-9]{2,4}\/[0-9]{1,2}` — I already follow these blogs via RSS, so I don't want to see their duplicate Twitter posts.

* `(?i)verynicewebsite\.net\/[0-9]{4}\/[0-9]{2}\/` — I'm already an RSS subscriber.

### Annoyances
* `(?i)(happy|geek) birthday` — I don't care if it's your birthday. Well, I do, but I just don't need to see all the replies.

* `(?i)(MenInBlazers).*(podcast)`

* `(?i)#geekqu(ot|to)es`

* `(?i)ICYMI` — I'm a Twitter completionist, so I've __not__ missed it.

* `(?i)^(new pod|ticket.*|watch live):`

* `(?i)^\@WhatTheBit.+`

* `(@\w+(.+)?){6,}` — Tweets with more than n recipients.

* `(MLB)|Dodgers|Giants|RedSox|Yankees` — Not a fan of baseball.

* `\n{5,}` — Posts with 5+ new lines.

* `#\w{20,}` — Posts that contain long hashtags.

* `^(@\w+ *)*(#\w+ *)+$`

* `^(@\w+\s*)+$`

* `^\#MacStoriesDeals.*` — I already subscribe to their dedicated deals feed. Once again too much noise.

* `relay\.fm\/(.+\/[0-9]+|live)` - I already subscribe to some of their podcasts and follow their podcasters, so seeing the constant tweets makes it noisy.

* `^I just backed.*@Kickstarter` - Once again, I don't need to see it.
